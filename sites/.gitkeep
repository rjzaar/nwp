# Sites Directory

All NWP site installations are placed in this directory to keep the repository root clean and organized.

## Directory Structure

Sites are installed at: `~/nwp/sites/<sitename>/`

Examples:
- `~/nwp/sites/nwp5/` - Development site
- `~/nwp/sites/nwp5_stg/` - Staging site
- `~/nwp/sites/avc/` - Custom-named site

## Usage

When you run:
```bash
pl install d mysite
```

The site is created at `~/nwp/sites/mysite/`

## Git Ignore

All contents of this directory are gitignored via the pattern `sites/*/` in the root `.gitignore` file. Only this `.gitkeep` file is tracked to preserve the directory structure.
