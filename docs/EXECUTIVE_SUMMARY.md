# Executive Summary: The Narrow Way Project (NWP)

## What It Is

NWP is a **website management automation system** that helps teams build, test, and publish professional websites quickly and safely. Think of it like a smart assembly line for websites — instead of building each site from scratch, you use tested blueprints ("recipes") that automate the repetitive work.

## The Problem It Solves

**Without NWP:** Setting up a new website involves dozens of manual steps — installing software, configuring databases, setting up security, connecting domains. Each step is an opportunity for human error, and the process can take days.

**With NWP:** One command, a few minutes, and you have a fully working website ready for customization.

## Who Uses It

- Organizations running multiple websites
- Development teams building sites for clients
- Educational institutions using online learning platforms
- Content networks sharing videos or media

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Recipe System** | Pre-built templates for common site types (social platforms, video sharing, learning management) |
| **One-Command Setup** | Create a complete website in minutes instead of hours |
| **Safe Deployment** | Test locally → review on staging → publish to production |
| **Automatic Backups** | Never lose work; restore any previous version |
| **Security Built-In** | Sensitive data is protected; passwords are kept separate from code |
| **Team Support** | Multiple people can work on the same projects without conflicts |

---

## Types of Sites It Creates

- **Standard websites** (Drupal CMS)
- **Social communities** (profiles, groups, messaging)
- **Video sharing platforms** (AV Commons)
- **Online learning systems** (Moodle)
- **Podcast hosting**

## Why It Matters

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Fewer errors** | Automation removes human mistakes |
| **Faster launches** | Days become minutes |
| **Lower risk** | Test everything before the public sees it |
| **Better security** | Sensitive data is protected by design |
| **Easier maintenance** | Backups, updates, and monitoring are built in |

---

## The Philosophy

The name "Narrow Way" reflects the approach: rather than offering endless options that create complexity, NWP provides **one well-tested path** that works reliably. Customization is still possible, but the defaults are sensible and safe.

## Bottom Line

NWP transforms website deployment from a complex, error-prone process into a reliable, repeatable workflow. Teams spend less time on technical setup and more time on what matters — building great websites.
