Subject: Request for Account-Wide SMTP Port Restriction Removal

Hello Linode Support,

I am requesting the removal of SMTP port restrictions (ports 25, 465, and 587) for my entire Linode account.

Current Linode: gitlab-nwp-1767074243

Use Case:
This account will be used to host multiple servers for web development and hosting purposes:

1. Development/Staging Servers - Testing sites in a live environment, including email functionality (notifications, password resets, form submissions)

2. Client Testing - Some sites will allow client access for review and testing, which requires working email notifications

3. Production Hosting - Sites will be hosted through this account, with the number of servers growing over time as our organisation expands

All email sent will be transactional in nature (notifications, alerts, password resets, etc.). Emails will never be used for spam or unsolicited marketing.

Compliance Confirmation:
- I confirm that all email sent from this account will be CAN-SPAM compliant
- I have reviewed and will adhere to Linode's Acceptable Use Policy (Section 2 - Abuse)
- rDNS will be configured for all server IP addresses
- All emails will be sent only to users who have explicitly opted in or registered on the hosted applications

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
