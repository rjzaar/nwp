# AVC Mobile App Development Options

An investigation into building Android/iOS apps with AVC functionality, ranked from easiest to most complex.

## AVC Features to Replicate

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **User Profiles** | Member dashboards, worklists |
| **Groups** | Group workflows, task dashboards |
| **Guilds** | Mentorship, scoring, endorsements |
| **Workflows** | Task assignment to users/groups |
| **Assets** | Project/document management |
| **Notifications** | Push notifications, digests |
| **Activity Feeds** | Social activity streams |

---

## Complexity Assessment: Can Each Option Handle AVC?

AVC is **not a simple app**. It's essentially:
- **Social network** (Open Social foundation)
- **Workflow engine** (state machines, task routing)
- **Group/Guild management** (permissions, mentorship, scoring)
- **Asset management** (documents, projects)
- **Custom dashboards** (worklists, activity feeds)

### Feature-by-Feature Analysis

#### 1. FlutterFlow + Firebase

| Feature | Can Handle? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| User profiles | ✅ Yes | Basic auth + Firestore |
| Groups | ⚠️ Partial | Manual permission logic |
| Guilds (mentorship, scoring) | ⚠️ Difficult | Complex data relationships |
| Workflow state machine | ❌ No | No built-in workflow engine |
| Task assignment | ⚠️ Basic only | No complex routing |
| Asset management | ✅ Yes | Firebase Storage |
| Notifications | ✅ Yes | FCM built-in |
| Activity feeds | ⚠️ Manual | Must build from scratch |

**Verdict: ❌ NO** - Too complex for no-code. You'd outgrow it quickly.

#### 2. Flet + Supabase

| Feature | Can Handle? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| User profiles | ✅ Yes | Supabase Auth + tables |
| Groups | ✅ Yes | PostgreSQL + RLS |
| Guilds (mentorship, scoring) | ⚠️ Possible | Custom tables + logic |
| Workflow state machine | ⚠️ Manual | Need to build yourself |
| Task assignment | ⚠️ Possible | Edge Functions + triggers |
| Asset management | ✅ Yes | Supabase Storage |
| Notifications | ⚠️ Partial | No push notifications built-in |
| Activity feeds | ⚠️ Manual | Real-time subscriptions help |

**Verdict: ⚠️ MAYBE** - Can technically handle it, but:
- Flet is immature (pre-1.0)
- You'd build most workflow logic from scratch
- No existing packages for guild/mentorship patterns
- Significant custom development needed

#### 3. Flutter + FastAPI

| Feature | Can Handle? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| User profiles | ✅ Yes | JWT + SQLAlchemy models |
| Groups | ✅ Yes | Custom models + permissions |
| Guilds (mentorship, scoring) | ✅ Yes | Full control to model |
| Workflow state machine | ✅ Yes | Use `transitions` library or custom |
| Task assignment | ✅ Yes | Full backend control |
| Asset management | ✅ Yes | S3/MinIO integration |
| Notifications | ✅ Yes | FCM + Celery |
| Activity feeds | ✅ Yes | Custom implementation |

**Verdict: ✅ YES** - Can handle full complexity, but:
- Requires learning Dart for Flutter frontend
- Significant development effort
- You're building AVC from scratch

#### 4. React Native + Django REST

| Feature | Can Handle? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| User profiles | ✅ Yes | Django User + DRF |
| Groups | ✅ Yes | **django-organizations** |
| Guilds (mentorship, scoring) | ✅ Yes | Custom models |
| Workflow state machine | ✅ Yes | **django-river** (designed for this) |
| Task assignment | ✅ Yes | **django-todo** or custom |
| Asset management | ✅ Yes | Django + S3 |
| Notifications | ✅ Yes | **django-notifications-hq** |
| Activity feeds | ✅ Yes | **django-activity-stream** |

**Verdict: ✅ YES - BEST OPTION** - Best existing package ecosystem:
- `django-river` = workflow state machine (like Drupal's workflow_assignment)
- `django-notifications-hq` = notification system
- `django-activity-stream` = activity feeds
- Django admin = content management

#### 5. BeeWare + FastAPI

| Feature | Can Handle? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| All backend features | ✅ Yes | Same as FastAPI option |
| Mobile UI complexity | ⚠️ Limited | Toga widget library is limited |
| Complex dashboards | ⚠️ Difficult | Less mature UI toolkit |
| Real-time updates | ⚠️ Harder | Less WebSocket support |

**Verdict: ❌ NO** - BeeWare's frontend isn't mature enough for AVC's UI complexity.

#### 6. No-Code (Adalo/Bubble/Glide)

**Verdict: ❌ NO** - AVC's workflow logic, guild system, and dashboard complexity exceeds what no-code platforms handle well.

### Summary: Can It Handle AVC?

| Option | Handle AVC? | Effort | Python % | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|--------|
| FlutterFlow + Firebase | ❌ No | Low | 0% | Too simple |
| Flet + Supabase | ⚠️ Maybe | High | 100% | Immature |
| **Flutter + FastAPI** | ✅ Yes | High | 50% | Viable |
| **React Native + Django** | ✅ Yes | High | 50% | **Best packages** |
| BeeWare + FastAPI | ❌ No | High | 100% | UI too limited |
| No-Code | ❌ No | Low | 0% | Too simple |

### Development Effort Reality

AVC on Drupal/Open Social benefits from:
- **Years of development** in Open Social
- **Drupal's mature ecosystem** (workflow, groups, notifications)
- **Pre-built social features** you'd need to recreate

Building AVC-equivalent in mobile means **rebuilding most of this from scratch**, regardless of framework.

| Approach | Estimated Development Effort |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Simplified AVC (core features only) | 3-6 months |
| Full AVC feature parity | 9-12+ months |

## Alternative: Flutter + FastAPI (If You Prefer Flutter)

If you prefer Flutter's UI or need higher API performance:

### Why This Stack?

1. **Flutter** - More popular than React Native, beautiful UI
2. **FastAPI** - Faster than Django for pure API workloads
3. **Full control** - Build exactly what you need
4. **Python backend** - 50% of code is Python

### Trade-offs vs Django

| Aspect | Django REST | FastAPI |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Workflow packages | ✅ django-river | ❌ Build yourself |
| Notifications | ✅ django-notifications-hq | ❌ Build yourself |
| Activity streams | ✅ django-activity-stream | ❌ Build yourself |
| Admin panel | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Build yourself |
| API Performance | Good | Better |
| Async support | Partial | Native |

**Bottom line:** FastAPI is faster but you'll write more code.

---

## Simplified AVC Option: Flet + Supabase (Python Only)

If you want 100% Python and can accept a **simplified feature set**:

### What You'd Need to Cut

| Full AVC Feature | Simplified Version |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Complex workflow states | Simple status field |
| Guild mentorship/scoring | Basic group membership |
| Digest notifications | Simple push only |
| Activity streams | Recent items list |
| Advanced dashboards | Basic task lists |

### Feature Implementation Map

| AVC Feature | Flet Component | Supabase Feature |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| User Profiles | Custom views | Auth + profiles table |
| Groups/Guilds | ListView, Cards | Tables with RLS |
| Workflows | State management | Edge Functions |
| Task Assignment | Forms, Lists | Foreign keys + triggers |
| Notifications | Snackbars | Realtime + webhooks |
| Assets | FileUploader | Storage buckets |
| Activity Feed | ListView | Real-time subscriptions |

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install Flet
pip install flet

# Create new project
mkdir avc-mobile && cd avc-mobile

# Create main.py and run
flet create myapp
cd myapp
flet run

# For mobile testing
flet run --android  # or --ios
```

### Honest Assessment

Flet + Supabase **can work** for a simplified AVC, but:
- Flet is pre-1.0 (expect bugs, API changes)
- No workflow state machine packages
- No notification digest system
- You're building 80% of logic from scratch
- Better suited for simpler apps

---

## Hybrid Approach: Keep Drupal Backend + Mobile Frontend

An alternative worth considering: **keep the existing Drupal/AVC backend** and add a mobile frontend.

### Why Consider This?

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **No backend rebuild** | AVC's workflow, groups, notifications already work |
| **Drupal JSON:API** | Built-in REST API for headless usage |
| **Faster to market** | Only build the mobile UI |
| **Shared data** | Web and mobile use same backend |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation Steps

1. Enable Drupal JSON:API module (already in core)
2. Configure CORS for mobile app access
3. Set up JWT authentication (Simple OAuth module)
4. Build mobile UI that consumes the API
5. Add Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications

### Trade-offs

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Fastest path to mobile | Still maintaining Drupal |
| No feature parity work | API may need customization |
| Single source of truth | Two frontends to maintain |
| Existing team knowledge | Mobile devs need Drupal API knowledge |

### When to Choose This

- You want mobile ASAP
- AVC features are already working well
- Team knows Drupal but not full-stack mobile
- Budget/time constraints

## Final Conclusion

### The Bottom Line

| Goal | Best Choice |
|------|-------------|
| **Full AVC feature parity** | React Native + Django REST |
| **Fastest path to mobile** | Hybrid (Drupal backend + mobile frontend) |
| **100% Python (simplified)** | Flet + Supabase |
| **Best UI + Python backend** | Flutter + FastAPI |

### Decision Matrix

```
Do you need FULL AVC features?
├── YES → Do you want to keep Drupal?
│         ├── YES → Hybrid: Mobile frontend + Drupal JSON:API
│         └── NO  → React Native + Django REST (best packages)
│
└── NO (simplified is OK) → Do you require 100% Python?
                            ├── YES → Flet + Supabase
                            └── NO  → Flutter + FastAPI
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **AVC is complex** - No-code and simple frameworks can't handle it
2. **Django has the best packages** for workflow, notifications, activity streams
3. **Hybrid approach** is fastest if you want to keep existing Drupal work
4. **100% Python mobile** is possible but requires accepting limitations
5. **Expect 3-12 months** of development depending on feature scope

### Next Steps

1. **Define MVP features** - Which AVC features are essential for mobile?
2. **Choose approach** - Full rebuild vs hybrid vs simplified
3. **Prototype** - Build a small proof-of-concept with chosen stack
4. **Validate** - Test with real users before full development
